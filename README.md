# ps4-ipi

PS4 IPI, short for Internal PKG Installer, is a PlayStation 4 utility homebrew app which will install PKG files from the HDD, making it possible to install PKG files using FTP.

It probably already exists in some way for PS4, but I mainly found this useful for myself so I decided to implement it.

## Usage

1. Install the PKG onto your PS4;
2. Enable FTP and upload the PKG you want to install to `/data`;
3. Run the app.
